 An electronic multiplexer can be considered as a multiple-input, single-output switch, and a demultiplexer as a single-input, multiple-output switch.

**2 X 1 Multiplexer:**

In digital circuit design, the selector wires are of digital value. In the case of a 2-to-1 multiplexer, a logic value of 0 would connect I0 (input A) to the output while a logic value of 1 would connect I1 (input B) to the output. In larger multiplexers, the number of selector pins is equal to log<sub>2</sub>n where n is the number of inputs.

A 2-to-1 multiplexer has a boolean equation where A and B are the two inputs, S is the selector input, and Z is the output: 

*Z = ( A . S') + (B . S)*

**Truth Table** 

|S|A|B|C|
|-|-|-|-|
|0|1|1|1|
|0|1|0|1|
|0|0|1|0|
|0|0|0|0|
|1|1|1|1|
|1|1|0|0|
|1|0|1|1|
|1|0|0|0|

**4 X 1 Multiplexer:**

Larger multiplexers are also common and requires ceil(log<sub>2</sub>n) selector pins for n inputs. Other common sizes are 4-to-1, 8-to-1, and 16-to-1. Since digital logic uses binary values, powers of 2 are used (4, 8, 16) to maximally control a number of inputs for the given number of selector inputs.
