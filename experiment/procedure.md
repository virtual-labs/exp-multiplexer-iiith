# 2-bit Multiplexer

## Components Required - 

* 2 OR gates
* 1 AND gate
* 1 NOT gate

## Circuit Connections - 

* Drag the first OR gate and connect its input points to the input bits A and Select.
* Drag the NOT gate and connect its input point to the Select input bit.
* Take another OR gate and connect its input points to the output point of the NOT gate and input bit B.
* Drag an AND gate and connect its input points to the output points of the two OR gates.
* Connect output of the AND gate to the output bit in the circuit.
* After setting the values of A, B, and Select click "Simulate". 

## Observations - 

* When Select is 0 the output is the value of A and when Select is 1 the output is the value of B.
* If the circuit has been made as described as above, then upon clicking the "Submit" button a "Success" message will be displayed.

# 4-bit Multiplexer

## Components Required - 

* 3 2-bit Multiplexers

## Circuit Connections - 

* Drag the first 2-bit Multiplexer and connect its input points A0 and B0 to the input bits I0 and I1 respectively.
* Connect its Select input point to the input bit S0.
* Drag the second 2-bit Multiplexer and connect its input points A0 and B0 to the input bits I2 and I3 respectively.
* Connect its Select input point to the input bit S0.
* Drag the third 2-bit Multiplexer and connect its input points A0 and B0 to the output points of first and second Multiplexer respectively.
* Connect its Select input point to the input bit S1 and its output point to the FinalOutput bit of the circuit.

## Observations - 

* When S1 is 0 the output of the first 2-bit Multiplexer is the output and when S1 is 1 the output of the second 2-bit Multiplexer is the output.
* If the circuit has been made as described as above, then upon clicking the "Submit" button a "Success" message will be displayed.
